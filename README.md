# Meningitis-Virus-Detection-using-ML

This project proposes a machine learning model SVM and Random Forest to detect meningitis virus. The models extracted significant features from the dataset then classified 3 classes: Healthy, Bacterial and Virus. Among different supervised learning techniques, we here explored the meningitis virus and many models of machine learning to compare all of them.

# Approach:

Data Analysis and Preprocessing: Utilize pandas for dataset analysis and preprocessing tasks. Employ matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization to gain insights into the dataset's characteristics and distributions.
Feature Extraction and Selection: Extract significant features from the dataset that are indicative of meningitis virus presence. Explore various feature selection techniques to enhance model performance.
Model Building and Evaluation: Implement SVM and Random Forest classifiers using the scikit-learn library. Train these models on the preprocessed dataset and evaluate their performance using appropriate metrics. Compare the performance of both models to identify the most effective approach for meningitis virus detection.
Label Encoding: Utilize label encoder from the scikit-learn library to convert categorical values into numerical format for model training. Encode categorical values into integers (0, 1, 2, etc.) to prepare the data for model input.
